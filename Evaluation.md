# MUSA6951_tutorial

# Evaluation

Clarity and organization of content
  + This tutorial is relatively straightforward, and splitting up the functions for two main uses - known and unknown ZIP codes - should help the user understand the package's features. 
  
Accuracy and correctness of code examples
  + The functions in this package are not complicated - I tried to minimize the number of examples since many functions follow similar steps. It may help to show more `zipcodeR` functionality with the PropertyShark data example, but I believe everything shown is correct.
  
Reproducibility
  + This tutorial should be reproducible since it is set up as an R Project file.

Presentation
  + The R Markdown should be easy to follow, with outputs formatted to be easily viewed
